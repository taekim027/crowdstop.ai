## Development

To install this repo, first install [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/), then run `poetry install` on a `python>=3.10` environment.

The `motrackers` package has a slight bug. I've raised [an issue](https://github.com/adipandas/multi-object-tracker/issues/51) on their repo but not sure if it will get resolved. Until then, we should make this change manually on the locally installed package.
